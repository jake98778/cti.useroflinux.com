# Welcome!!!

Welcome to my Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) project! I built this over a single weekend, driven by frustration with juggling multiple news sources just to stay updated on security news. My goal was simple: CTI should be effortless, accessible through a single website, and eliminate the need to hop between endless lists of sources.

This tool is designed for everyone—cybersecurity professionals tracking the latest threats, enthusiasts eager to stay on the cutting edge, or anyone curious about the security landscape. It’s completely free to use, with no restrictions beyond the terms of the GNU license.

I’ll keep this hosted for as long as I can, but you’re welcome to fork it, host it wherever you like, and make it your own. All I ask is that you credit me for the original site, so others can find their way back to this project and contribute to its growth. Let’s build something great together!
